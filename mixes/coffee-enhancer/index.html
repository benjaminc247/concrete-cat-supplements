      Benefits and drawbacks are mixed when taken alone, but when taken with caffeine, negative
      affects of each are counteracted by the other, and positive affects are magnified.
    </p>
    <p>
      When taken with caffeine:<br>
      Improves measures of attention, reaction time, working memory, and mental fatigue over
      caffeine alone<br>
      Reduces measures of stress and anxiety that are increased when taking caffeine alone<br>
      Counteracts increased blood pressure and reduced sleep quality caused by caffeine alone<br>

    <p>
      Safety:<br>
      Non-essential amino acid not produced by the body<br>
      Naturally occurring in tea ~14mg/8oz<br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019564/</a><br>
      No adverse affects have been observed in any study, including animal studies using doses 640x
      maximum doses used in human studies<br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16759779/</a><br>
      Studies focusing on safety in humans are lacking
    </p>
    <p>
      Dosage:<br>
      Most studies between 100-400mg<br>
      Theanine:caffeine ratios - tea 1:3, studies between 1:1 and 2:1, most supplements 2:1

  <div class="collapsible" data-heading="L-Tyrosine (500mg)">
    <p>
      <a>https://examine.com/supplements/l-tyrosine/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies to prove effectiveness are lacking, but mechanism of action and anecdotal results are
      strong. Tyrosine has become ubiquitous in pre-workouts and combining with caffeine is
      promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caffeine stimulates production of catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. Tyrosine is a
      precursor to those catecholamines and may become depleted, this seems to be involved in
      post-caffeine crash and in caffeine withdrawals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduced impairment in a stressful environment:<br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2736402/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Enhanced cognitive performance when dopamine and norepinephrine have been depleted:<br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424423/</a><br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797188/</a>
    </p>
    <p> Improved focus, attention, and reaction time when Tyrosine is paired with caffeine and
      theanine:<br>
      <a>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6880365/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anecdotally, pairing Tyrosine with caffeine has several results:<br>
      Enhances the 'euphoria' feeling from caffeine, most likely due to allowing for higher dopamine
      production.<br>
      Reduces post-caffeine crash, most likely by preventing short time deficiency.<br>
      Reduces caffeine tolerance, dependence, and withdrawals, most likely by preventing long term
      deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety:<br>
      Non essential amino acid produced by the body<br>
      Naturally occurring in many foods<br>
      RDI ~875mg/day<br>
      Doses of up to 10g used in human studies with no adverse affects<br>
      <a>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29168741/</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dosage:<br>
      Doses used in studies are very high, minimum effective dosage has not been established.<br>
      Anecdotally 1.5-2g/day seems to be effective and is what is used in most supplements
